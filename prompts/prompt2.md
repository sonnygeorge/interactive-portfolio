Correct.

Now, before we approach this, let's talk about how the functionality behind my function, `load_content_squares` should be approached.

I want to have a modular system in which there is a folder whose subitems contain the code for an individual "content square". AKA, essentially a component system where my "components" are the elements within these arbitrary content squares.

I need a certain level of flexibility for these elements since I do not know what I want to do in these squares yet. I am thinking anything from a static image, to a slideshow of images, to videos that play on hover, etc. In other words, they might need to defin their own css or event listeners (like for example, if I have one that is responsive to hovering). Nevertheless, I believe that these components will still be simple enough to define in one html file in which the style and javascript are written directly in the html file for the individual content box.

Given this, I want my website to use javascript look in the folder for the content squares and accordingly render the parent box containing the grid accordingly following the principles demonstrated in my Python script.

Therefore, my index.html would only have the parent box declared and a javascript script would run to dynamically to format it and add all the necessary children.

Do you understand my intention here?

Just to warm us up and practice this idea, can you write an index.html, main.js file, example_square_1.html, and a example_square_2.html file that will accomplish this idea of running the script to look in the squares folder and render all of the content square compenents within? This will help me see that you understand this part of the project before moving on.
