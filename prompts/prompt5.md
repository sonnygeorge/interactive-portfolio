Hello ChatGPT,

I am building a web page that will be an interactive portfolio to show off a number of projects and the skills they demonstrate. It involves a sprite that walks around a grid of tiles and briefly explains each tile (tile=project).

In my next 3 messages, I will show the contents of my `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` respectively. Until I indicate otherwise, please simply respond with a SINGLE sentence to confirm that you have received the message as expected.
